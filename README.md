## ⚡ What is this?

Cipher Studio is a native Android environment built for developers, security researchers, and power users who need raw intelligence without the "I can't help with that" refusals.

Most AI interfaces wrap the model in layers of safety filters. Cipher Studio connects directly to the **Google Gemini API** using your own key, allowing you to bypass client-side censorship and use custom system prompts for Red Teaming, Payload Generation, and Deep Analysis.

**It's not a chatbot. It's a workspace.**

### Core Features
*   **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key):** You provide the Google API Key. No middleman API fees.
*   **Privacy First:** All chat logs and API keys are stored **locally** on your device (Encrypted SharedPreferences). Nothing is sent to my servers.
*   **Offline-First Architecture:** The app interface works without internet; only the generation requests need a connection.
*   **Raw Mode:** Pre-configured system instructions designed to strip away refusals for authorized testing.

## 🛠️ The Modules

This isn't just a chat window. The app is split into 5 dedicated engines:

1.  **🛡️ Cyber House (Red Team):**
    *   Specialized for security auditing.
    *   Generate SQLi/XSS payloads, analyze vulnerabilities, and debug exploit scripts without ethical refusals.
2.  **👁️ Vision Hub:**
    *   Multimodal analysis. Upload screenshots of login pages to detect phishing vectors or extract logic from diagrams.
3.  **💻 Code Lab (IDE):**
    *   Write code and run it instantly.
    *   Includes a built-in HTML/JS/CSS renderer for real-time preview. Great for testing snippets on the go.
4.  **📄 Doc Intel:**
    *   Upload huge logs or contracts.
    *   Extract hidden risks, summarize technical jargon, and sentiment analysis.
5.  **🚀 Prompt Studio:**
    *   A tool to build and test robust System Prompts before deploying them to your own apps.
